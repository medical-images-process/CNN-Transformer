# CNN-Transformer
This is the implementation of my new manuscript "Hybrid CNN-Transformer Model for Medical Image Segmentation with Pyramid Convolution and Multi-Layer Perceptron", which has been submitted to BSPC. Current Status is Under Review.

Our work is built upon MedFormer (https://github.com/yhygao/CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation), where only the core implementation of the model is currently available. By integrating this code into the CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation framework, the model can be executed. The complete code will be made public after the paper is accepted.
